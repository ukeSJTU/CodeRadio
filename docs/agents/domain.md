# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the repo root.
- **`docs/adr/`**: read ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in.

If these files don't exist, **proceed silently**. Don't flag their absence or suggest creating them upfront. The `/domain-modeling` skill—reached via `/grill-with-docs` and `/improve-codebase-architecture`—creates them lazily when terms or decisions actually get resolved.

## File structure

This is a single-context repository:

```text
/
├── CONTEXT.md
├── docs/
│   └── adr/
├── CodeRadio/
├── CodeRadioTests/
└── CodeRadioUITests/
```

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept—in an issue title, refactor proposal, hypothesis, or test name—use the term as defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept you need isn't in the glossary yet, reconsider whether you're inventing language the project doesn't use or note the genuine gap for `/domain-modeling`.

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding:

> _Contradicts ADR-0007 (event-sourced orders), but worth reopening because…_
